Defaults:
make-result-file-on-finished = True
print-result = False 

use-mingw = False #Make it True ONLY u wanna use gcc alongside javapython.
delay-ms = "DO_NOT_USE" #Dont touch here or program didnt work

make-result-file-on-finished:
  If you are need results in a sheet (i mean txt file, if you want datasheet, but its not comed YET), then make it True. I already maked it true
  
print-result:
  If you are want print the results on screen ( unrecommended, might be buggy) then make it True.
  
use-mingw:
  Dont touch before v1.5 update came out
  
delay-ms:
  Dont touch.
  
Exe or py file?
Of course i reccomend.

Known Bugs:

1-print-result
  1.1-Prints all the combo list
